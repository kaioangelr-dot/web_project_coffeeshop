# Project Triple Espresso Coffee Shop

## About

Triple Espresso is a project with core features, including iframes and forms. It's designed to be a comfortable and welcoming website related to a coffee shop, which allows users to book tables, check the coffee shop's schedule, and contact the staff, as well as engage with social media channels.

## Features

### Navigation links

On the top page, there are navigation links, which are a feature that allows the user to easily navigate through the page and interact with different sections. In this project, I decided to put it at the beginning of the page. I think it would also be suitable to make it fixed, following on top of the user's screen while they navigate through the page.

### Iframes

This feature allows us to add other websites to our own website. I decided to add cooking recipes from YouTube.

### Forms

Here, the customer can sign up and book a table in the coffee shop. I limited the number of guests per booking.

### Interactivity and Pseudo-Classes

I applied the hover and focus pseudo-classes in the navigation links, the reservation button, and social links, which adds interactivity with the links and improves the usability.
Further, I would like to add more modern interactivity features in this project, making the bubbles on the background move when the user scrolls, or adding a zoom effect in the reservation section's button without affecting its performance.

### Modularity

I'm proud of the modularity in this project, especially in the Blocks' directory. This project was made with the BEM method, thinking about making the different components in CSS and HTML reusable across different parts of the project, or in further projects. There are different directories planned to better organize my code, making debugging easier, and facilitating collaboration with other developers.
